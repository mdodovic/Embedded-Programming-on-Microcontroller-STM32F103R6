# Embedded-Programming-on-Microcontroller-STM32F103R6

Microcontroller STM32F103R6 controls different systems:

#### temparature_sensor_STM32F103R6_fan_light_signal_keyboard_controll
Realize temparature sensor and fan speed controlling (based on temparature). Show temparature on LCD display, controll score using virutal terminal (UART protocol). Keyboard is realized to controll fan speed.

#### temparature_sensor_STM32F103R6_fan_controller
Realize temparature sensor and fan speed controlling (based on temparature). Show temparature on LCD display, controll score using virutal terminal (UART protocol).

#### double_MCU_input_output_velocity_speed_state_singaling
Double microcontrollers communicate using USART protocol. One microcontroller is collecting commands for motors' speed and those commands are executed using the other microcontroller.

#### double_STM32F103R6_2_motors_lcd_for_velocity
Double microcontrollers communicate using USART protocol. One microcontroller is collecting commands for motors' speed and those commands are executed using the other microcontroller. Commands and velocities are shown using LCD display

#### stopwatch_basketball_game
Realize basketball monitoring system. Show result on LCD display, controll score using EXTI peripherals. Match time is counting using microcontroller's timer.

#### stopwatch_tennis_game
Realize tennis monitoring system. Show result on LCD display, controll score using EXTI peripherals. Match time is counting using microcontroller's timer.

#### toggling_diodes_stopwatch
Periodically diodes toggling. Time is counting using microcontroller's timer.

#### configuration_timer_interrupts
Genreate timer interrupts on alternating 0.5s and 1s.

#### configuration_timer_interrupts_CUBEMX
Genreate timer interrupts on alternating 0.5s and 1s using cubeMX software.

#### scb-and-nvic-interrupts
Genreate timer interrupts, interrupts from SCB and NVIC peripherals.

#### dynamic_timer_fetching_current_interrupt
Genreate timer interrupts and interrupts from NVIC peripherals.
 
#### dynamic_timer_interrupts
Genreate timer interrupts and interrupts from NVIC peripherals.
